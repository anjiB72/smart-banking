# Smart Banking Feature

This is a java programme that runs from the command line.

It takes a CSV (comma separated values) file of account transactions, and undertakes an automatic transfer of funds from a savings account to a current account if
the current account has a negative balance at the end of the day.

It outputs a new file with the original transaction plus the new automated transactions.
